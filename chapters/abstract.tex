Nature has many attractive properties such as self-repair, scalability, adaptation, massive parallelism, distributive...

There are hopes that using bio-inspired methods to integrate those properties into man-made technology will revolutionize computing.

NTNU has created an FPGA platform, whose goal is to allow research on CAs.

Due to many problems with existing design, the entire platform has been rebuilt with a more modular cleaner, and scalable design.

Additions include better control flow and adaptive API.

The platform is shown to work correctly through unit tests and example programs.

It is a complete system for further CA research.

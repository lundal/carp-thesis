Unconventional machines – what are they?
Hardware implementations are much faster than simulations.
FPGAs are not as fast as ASICs, but a FPGA design is simple to port to ASIC.
CARP is a proof-of-principle.

Living organisms exhibit a range of desirable characteristics:
Graceful degradation, Robustness, Redundancy, self-assembly.

\todo{Motivation}
Research tool.
Self-assembly.
Performance/energy gain.

\todo{Method}
Bio inspired.
Evolution and development.

\todo{Conseptual description of machine}
CA + Development + Host API

\todo{Implementation in FPGA}

The initial work was done by Dupdal, and was promptly extended by Aamodt.

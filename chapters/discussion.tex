\section{Warnings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most are due to parameterization
    \item Many from generated PCIE core
    \item Nearly all filtered to make output more readable and make it easier to find bugs
    \item Could not remove remaining due to limited filter system (don't want to cause trouble later)
    \item 728 in ISE (684 filtered)
    \item 502 in XST (457 filtered)
    \item Why the difference?
    \item Also filtered "equivalent register removal" infos to reduce clutter
\end{itemize}

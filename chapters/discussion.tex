\section{Warnings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most are due to parameterization
    \item Many from generated PCIE core
    \item Nearly all filtered to make output more readable and make it easier to find bugs
    \item Could not remove remaining due to limited filter system (don't want to cause trouble later)
    \item 728 in ISE (684 filtered)
    \item 502 in XST (457 filtered)
    \item Why the difference?
    \item Also filtered "equivalent register removal" infos to reduce clutter
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hazard detection unit so multiple modules can run simultaneously
    \item DMA-based communication interface (better speed, requires driver, more advanced com module)
    \item Watchdog-timer/Stall-prevention
\end{itemize}

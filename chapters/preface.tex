This master's thesis has been conducted at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology under supervision of Associate Professor Gunnar Tufte.

The thesis counts for 30 credits and is the continuation of a 15-credit specialization project conducted autumn 2014.
It concludes a 5-year master of science study in Computer Science.

I would like to personally thank Gunnar Tufte for his invaluable inspiration and support, and Odd Rune Strømmen Lykkebø who stepped in during his brief absence.
